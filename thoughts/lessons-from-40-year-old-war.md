# Modern Lessons from a 40-Year-Old War

Hi!

It’s the 40th anniversary of the Falklands War this year, and thinking on it I see some interesting lessons that we can pull forward into the modern day. I figured this might be a nice point for some discussion here!

First of all, why do I think these lessons might be applicable to our modern day? Well, because the Falklands was, really, the last time a Western country fought a peer adversary (say what you like about '91, but let’s be honest: that wasn’t a peer fight). And as such, despite the span of time, it has some useful lessons, I think. Some of which cannot be learned from the current Russo-Ukrainian conflict (for reasons I’ll explore in a bit)

What exactly are these lessons?

## Expeditionary Logistics are Really Tough!

Logistics were a perpetual problem for the British Task Force, and indeed (to a lesser extent) the Argentinian forces too. The British were operating at the end of an 8000-mile-long supply line, at very very short notice - until the sinking of the Belgrano, really, no-one in political (or indeed military) power expected hostilities to actually “go hot”.

In an environment where we are orientating towards China, the question becomes: can we support such operations in the long-term, logistically? My belief is that every large-force exercise Nato conducts nowadays should have a logistics angle to it (my vision is one where we, for example, run a RED FLAG exercise but where there is only enough AMRAAMs for, say, 10 - for argument’s sake - sorties). Nato commanders - particularly those at the middle levels; the captains etc - need to get used to making priority calls on usage of their precious supplies.

Relatedly, the British learned, with the loss of Atlantic Conveyor, the risks of putting too many logistical eggs in one basket - and the havoc that can be caused by the loss of that basket. The Atlantic Conveyor was carrying all of the Task Force’s heavy-lift Chinook helicopters; when it was lost, the force was left with only one. The whole movement and support plan for the Marines and Paras on the ground had been built around using helicopters to get around, particularly using the Chinooks to rapidly reposition artillery batteries to support the ground forces’ advance. All this was now out the window, and critical priority calls had to be made around how the vital helicopter resource would best be used - the attack on Goose Green was left with too few supporting artillery because the helicopters were in use elsewhere.

In my view, this lesson should also be incorporated into Nato training (imagine, again, RED FLAG but this time on day two the “umpire” announces that Nellis’ primary runway has been knocked out, or an enemy SOF raid has blown up three F16s). Attrition and losses, and how to respond to loss of critical capability must be part of regular training.

## Public Opinion has Direct Bearing on Military Action

On the topic of Goose Green: that was a prime example of a battle that never needed to be fought. It was driven by a desire from the political side for the ground forces to be seen to do something, after several days collecting themselves at San Carlos, during which time the Royal Navy had been suffering serious losses. Those losses had to be seen to mean something, to not be in vain.

At the heart of this lies the problem that an expeditionary conflict is inherently difficult to sell to the general public - particularly once losses start to mount. Take the example of Ukraine, on the other hand - do we think the Ukrainian public would be nearly so united in support, if their troops were instead fighting in defence of, say, Georgia?

There have also long been arguments that Western countries simply cannot sustain public support in the face of the losses that a peer conflict would inflict. In a war of national defence, perhaps the public would summon the “Blitz spirit” as it’s sometimes called in the UK. But would the public be as willing to support sending hundreds and thousands of their young men to their deaths for an island on the other side of the world? The lesson of the Falklands is that the answer is only “maybe”.

## Decision-Making gets Pushed Down

In an expeditionary war, in particular, the responsibility for decision-making gets pushed down far below where it normally lies. The “span of control”, as it’s sometimes known, for a combat commander broadens.

In the Falklands, a Brigadier (Thompson) was in charge of the entire ground forceduring the critical early phases, and was only replaced (by Major-General Jeremy Moore) late in the campaign - and even that handover introduced a dangerous level of friction. Thompson was in charge of planning the ground component of the amphibious landing at San Carlos, and then in charge of planning how to get the 3rd Commando Brigade rolling out towards Stanley. It was an incredible amount of pressure to place on the shoulders of a comparitively low-rank officer. Thankfully he was well up to the task.

We must ensure that our officers are trained and prepared to take on responsibilities above and beyond their normal peacetime state. We must also ensure that those in political power, and those high up in the military hierarchy, and cogniscent of the asks that they are placing on comparitively junior officers.

## Target-Fixate at Your Peril

One of the most disappointing weapon systems on the British side was the Sea Dart: an air defence system designed to protect the fleet against high-flying Soviet bombers. The entire Royal Navy was orientated towards the Soviet threat. This led to some key gaps in its ability to wage a war of a different nature.

We need to be careful of locking us into a specific scenario, because real life will always surprise us. As we re-orientate towards China, we must ensure that our solutions are not so specific that they cannot then be used in non-China scenarios.

## In Deploying Forces, be Ready to Employ Force

As I alluded to earlier, nobody in political power in the UK (and nobody at HQ in Northwood) expected the Task Force to actually be called upon to fight, when it was despatched. The expectation was for it to be merely a “show of force”; a deterrent.

My belief is that politicians and military leaders should always be ready to employ force, when they deploy forces. We can liken this to the common firearms guidance: “if you point your gun at it, you must be prepared to take the shot”. Whenever we deploy forces in a deterrent posture, we must always always be mindful of the fact that the deterrence might not work.In which case, a decision will need to be made: do we employ our force, or do we back down?

## Infantry is Still King

For all the emphasis on motorised mobility in Western nations at the time, the Falklands War was ultimately won by well-trained, well-led, well-motivated young men engaging in close combat with the enemy, and moving across the battlefield on foot.

In all the frenzy of all-domain, netowrk-centric, long-range-fires-supported operations, we should not lose our focus on the individual fighting soldier. We should not lose sight of the fact that all those other domains merely support that soldier. And we should not allow that soldier’s ability to fight in close, on their own two feet, to atrophy in favour of high-tech solutions.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you agree that there are some critical lessons that can still be learned and applied from the Falklands War to the modern day peer fight.
